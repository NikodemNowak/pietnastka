# Pietnastka (15-Puzzle)

## About the Project

"Pietnastka" is a Python implementation of the classic 15-puzzle problem. This project focuses on file-based processing and algorithmic solutions rather than a graphical interface. The program reads puzzle configurations from input files and outputs the solution or relevant information.

This project was developed as a university assignment by Nikodem Nowak and Mateusz Kosowski.

## Features

- File-based input and output operations
- Algorithms for solving the 15-puzzle problem
- Analysis of puzzle solvability
- Solution path generation
- Performance benchmarking capabilities

## Implementation Details

The program operates entirely through file operations:
1. Reads puzzle configurations from input files
2. Processes the puzzle using implemented algorithms
3. Outputs results to specified files

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3** - Core programming language
- Various Python standard libraries for file operations and data structures

## Usage
